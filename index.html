        <p class="intro-text">
          Every time you swipe through TikTok, scroll through Instagram, or open up DoorDash, you're being quietly nudged toward certain foods. It's not an accident. Artificial intelligence is shaping your appetite, your cravings, and even your access to food without you realizing it. The meals you "discover," the restaurants that pop up first, and the deals you get offered have algorithms behind them that are designed not to nourish you but to maximize engagement and profit.
        </p>
        <p class="intro-text">
          This matters. Because while these systems might feel convenient, they're far from neutral. AI decides which restaurants get visibility, which foods go viral, and who pays more for the same meal. Studies show that <b>36%</b> of TikTok users have ordered food after seeing it on the app and that <b> 65%</b> of content creators say the app directly shapes their food choices (MGH, 2021). Platforms track your behaviors, likewhat you like, what you view, what you click on, and then feed you more of what will keep you scrolling or ordering, no matter how healthy, local, or affordable it is.
        <p class="intro-text">
          Worse still, these systems don't work the same for everyone. In some neighborhoods, algorithms offer fewer restaurant options or charge higher delivery fees. AI personalizes results based on location, past behavior, and perceived spending habits, meaning your access to food is being filtered through layers of code you can't see or control.
        </p>
        <p class="intro-text">
          In this following project, we will explore how these systems function, why it matters, and what you can do to identify and challenge the hidden forces behind what you put on your project. We'll uncover how these systems work, why they matter, and what you can do to spot and question the invisible forces shaping your plate.
