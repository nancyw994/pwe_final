          <h1>Who Gets Impacted Unequally</h1>
          <p class="lead">
            AI food recommendations may seem convenient, but they can quietly reinforce inequality. Schanzenbach and Pitts (2020) found that lower-income users ordered more fast food through delivery apps due to local economic conditions and fewer choices. While 93% of Americans live in a food delivery zone, that doesn’t mean the experience is equal. In lower-income ZIP codes, delivery tends to be slower, more expensive, and less diverse.
          </p>
          <p class="lead lead--narrow">
            Having access to an app isn’t access to healthy or affordable food. Algorithmic personalization often pushes disadvantaged users toward less healthy or pricier options, and they may not even realize it.

        <h2>Pricing Disparities: Higher Costs for Some Neighborhoods</h2>
        <div class="text-media text-media--two-column">
          <div class="text-media__text">
            <p>
              Food delivery is supposed to be convenient, but that convenience comes at a higher cost for some communities.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Delivery Fees:</strong>  In general, low-income ZIP codes tend to have higher fees due to fewer drivers and limited restaurant options nearby.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Surge Pricing:</strong> During peak times (nights, weekends, bad weather), surge pricing kicks in. These increases have hit low-driver regions the hardest, even though these users may have few affordable food options left.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              The Brookings Institution warns that these price gaps widen food inequality, especially for those already struggling with food insecurity (George & Tomer, 2022). It's not just about convenience, it's about fairness.

        <h2>Limited Access and Digital Food Deserts</h2>
        <p>
          Even though most areas fall within delivery zones, what people can actually access and how reliably differs a lot.

            <h3>Slower Delivery Times</h3>
            <p>
              Fewer drivers means longer waits in lower-income or rural areas.

            <h3>Fewer Restaurants Listed</h3>
            <p>
              If your neighborhood lacks nearby restaurants, apps won't show many results. It limits people's choice and variety.

            <h3>Data Gaps</h3>
            <p>
              Some users may not have smartphones, strong internet, or app experience. This makes it harder to even place orders.
            </p>
          </article>
        </div>
        <p>
          Even though 90% of traditional "food desert" areas now have at least one food delivery option, apps don't necessarily provide affordable or healthy meals (Schanzenbach & Pitts, 2020). In other words, just being "online" doesn't fix everything.

        <h2>Visibility Gaps for Small and Immigrant-Owned Restaurants</h2>

          Algorithms don't just influence what we eat, they also control who gets visibility.

              <h3>Cultural Bias</h3>
              <p>
                Foods that photograph poorly or don't match Western aesthetic trends are algorithmically de-prioritized.

          </article>
        </div>
        <p>
          This makes it harder for immigrant-owned and culturally significant restaurants to reach customers, even if their food is great (Keeble et al., 2021). The result in your feed becomes repetitive, and food discovery loses its cultural flavor.

              <li>
                <strong>Lower pay or bonuses</strong>

            <p>
              As Rosenblat (2018) explains, gig workers often navigate automated rules they can't see or challenge, directly affecting their income and job security.

        <h2>What Can We Do?</h2>
        <p>
          Food delivery apps make ordering easy, but that convenience doesn't show up equally for everyone. From higher fees to limited options, the system often works better for some users than others.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, what can you do as a conscious consumer?
