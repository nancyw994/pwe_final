          <h1>What Ethical AI Should Look Like</h1>
          <p class="lead">
            When you use a food delivery app, you've probably noticed that the same restaurants or meals always show up at the top of the list. But have you ever thought about the ethical issues behind that? Most AI systems aren't designed to be fair. Ethical AI should work for everyone, not only the biggest brands. It should give small, independent restaurants a real chance to compete, be transparent about how rankings are made, and take responsibility for how your personal data is collected and used. Ultimately, ethical AI should help you discover a wider variety of food options, not just promote what's easiest or most profitable to sell.

          <h2>Who Holds the Power</h2>
          <p>
            Apps like DoorDash and Uber Eats aren't just helping you get lunch. They're making decisions about which businesses get seen and which don't. That's real power, and it comes with real responsibility. Some researchers have found that if a restaurant does not pay to advertise on these platforms, it is likely that the restaurant will not even appear in the customer's feed on many of these platforms (Chen et al., 2025). When visibility depends too heavily on who can pay, small local restaurants struggle to compete, and users are shown a narrow range of options. Platform responsibility means recognizing this power and actively preventing algorithms from quietly favoring only the biggest brands.
          </p>

        <article class="ethical-card" data-animate>
          <h2>Design Solutions</h2>
          <p>
            Beyond responsibility, platforms should also intentionally create equitable opportunities for all users. Research shows that when a user continuously orders from larger chains, algorithms will continue to amplify the same chain, resulting in the displacement of smaller and/or independent restaurants (Chen et al., 2025). This creates a feedback loop where only already-popular restaurants continue to grow. An ethical system could:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Bundle restaurants</strong>, by providing boosts to smaller and independent restaurants on occasion</li>
            <li><strong>Encourage users to frequent diverse local restaurants</strong> included in "recommended" sections</li>
            <li><strong>Provide users with recommendations</strong> based on other variables beyond previous experience ordering</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Each of these choices will promote a fair competitive landscape and maintain the diversity of the local food system.
          </p>

        <article class="ethical-card" data-animate>
          <h2>User Control</h2>
          <p>
            If users want to be able to see how to find what they are looking for first on an app, they need to be educated about the processes that determine where items are located within the app. In the Digital Services Act, it now states that digital service platforms in Europe must explain their recommendation systems in a clear and concise manner and allow users to control these settings (Kratzer & Michou, 2025). Some companies, like Wolt, are developing apps with features that allow users to sort restaurants by time of day and what trend is currently trending (Wolt, 2025). In order to establish a fair sorting method, users should have the ability to sort their choices based on:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Price</strong>, so that they can find affordable alternatives quickly</li>
            <li><strong>Distance</strong> for faster delivery times</li>
            <li><strong>Ability to see new/different options</strong> versus just seeing what is currently trending</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Additionally, paid ads must be clearly marked as such, to ensure users can distinguish between an "organic" recommendation and a sponsored recommendation.
          </p>

        <article class="ethical-card" data-animate>
          <h2>Pricing Transparency</h2>
          <p>
            Hidden fees are one of the biggest sources of frustration on food-delivery apps. To address this, some states and cities have introduced "junk fee" bans that aim to prevent misleading price advertising and require companies to clearly disclose mandatory charges instead of hiding them until checkout (Federal Trade Commission, 2023).
          </p>
          <p>
            California, for example, implemented Senate Bill 478, which makes it illegal for many businesses to advertise a price that does not include all required fees (California Office of the Attorney General, 2024). However, a later amendment created a restaurant exemption, meaning some food-service fees may still be displayed separately as long as they are clearly disclosed (Greenberg Traurig, 2024). Even with these limits, better transparency helps diners understand what they are paying and helps restaurant owners see where their money goes, without last-minute surprises.

        <article class="ethical-card" data-animate>
          <h2>Policy Solutions</h2>
          <p>
            The EU's AI Act and Digital Services Act are leading the way, mandating that platforms audit their algorithms and assess their impact. Several states in the U.S. are examining the banning of "surveillance pricing," where users will be charged based on personal data. All these policies aim at the structural level to make food platforms less manipulative and more accountable.

        <article class="ethical-card" data-animate>
          <h2>Audit Requirements for Recommender Systems</h2>
          <p>
            Just like financial systems get audited, algorithms should be audited too. Under the Digital Services Act, large platforms must allow regulators or independent experts to examine how their recommendation systems operate and whether they are fair (Latham & Watkins, 2023). Algorithms can reveal problems, such as bias towards certain neighbourhoods and cuisines, by conducting audits. They can also ensure that companies are doing what they say they are doing.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="ethical-card" data-animate>
          <h2>Economic Fairness</h2>
          <p>
            Some platforms quietly adjust prices based on user behavior and location. Ethical AI policies argue against this kind of hidden personalized pricing. Proposed regulations would require platforms to explain price changes clearly and allow restaurants to retain control over their menu prices (Greenberg Traurig, 2024). The goal is to stop hidden pricing tactics and protect both consumers and small businesses.

        <article class="ethical-card" data-animate>
          <h2>User Protection</h2>
          <p>
            Ethical AI must also protect personal data. Laws like Europe's GDPR and newer state-level privacy laws in the U.S. require platforms to explain what data they collect and how it is used. While these protections are still imperfect, they limit platforms' ability to quietly build detailed profiles of users based on behavior like late-night orders or dietary preferences.

          <h3>Support Local Restaurants Directly</h3>
          <p>
            When you order from or visit small neighborhood spots, you're supporting real people, not just feeding an algorithm. It also helps reduce how much power big platforms have over what gets seen.

          <h3>Diversify Your Feed</h3>
          <p>
            Try new cuisines, adjust your app settings, or follow lesser-known restaurants on social media. Stepping outside your usual recommendations helps break the repetition that algorithms create.
          </p>

        <article class="action-card" data-animate>
          <h3>Recognize the Nudges</h3>
          <p>
            Labels like "only two left" or "top-rated near you" are designed to steer your choices. Once you notice these tactics, it becomes easier to make intentional decisions instead of automatically following what the algorithm pushes.
