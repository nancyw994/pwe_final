          <p class="lead">
            Food culture used to be shaped mostly by family traditions, local communities, and where you grew up. However, nowadays, a large proportion of the food culture is shaped by algorithms. What you see on TikTok, Instagram, and food delivery apps doesn't just influence what you order, it influences what feels trendy, normal, and worth paying attention to. Behind the scenes, algorithms are actively deciding which foods become popular, which cuisines get visibility, and which traditions quietly fade into the background.

        <h2>Why Some Foods Go Viral and Others Don't</h2>
        <p>
          On visual platforms, how food looks often matters more than what it means. According to eye-tracking research by Riswanto et al. (2025), people's attention is drawn most strongly to four specific visual elements:
        </p>
        
        <div class="text-media text-media--two-column">
          <div class="visual-factors">
            <div class="visual-factor">
              <h3>Bright, Saturated Colors</h3>
              <p>Think neon-pink dragonfruit bowls or unnaturally vibrant ramen. These colors stop the scroll.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="visual-factor">
              <h3>Clean, Glossy Plating</h3>
              <p>A perfectly drizzled sauce or a single mint leaf placed just right signals that this food is "worth" your attention.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="visual-factor">
              <h3>Visible Branding or Logos</h3>
              <p>A Starbucks cup or a branded takeout box tells viewers exactly what they're looking at and where to get it, reducing friction between seeing and buying.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="visual-factor">
              <h3>Human Faces, Especially Influencers</h3>
              <p>When someone you follow takes a bite and smiles, the algorithm knows you're more likely to engage and to order the same thing.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="visual-factor">
              <h3>Short, Fast-Paced Video Formats</h3>
              <p>Quick cuts, satisfying sounds, and 15-second clips keep you watching. The algorithm prioritizes video content that holds attention, making dynamic food videos far more visible than still images.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          
          <figure class="text-media__media">
            <img src="photo/qaqaq.webp" alt="Person photographing food for social media" class="viral-food-img" />

          </figure>
        </div>
        
        <p>
          These visuals naturally generate more likes, shares, and saves. Since algorithms are designed to promote whatever gets the most engagement, these eye-catching foods spread faster and farther. Over time, foods that look "perfect" on screen are treated as more valuable than foods that are culturally meaningful or widely eaten in everyday life.
          </p>
          <p>
          However, home-cooked meals, street food, and traditional dishes with simple visuals often receive far less exposure, even though they are more related to real communities and culture. The things that go viral are not necessarily what people eat most, it's what fits the visual rules of the platform.

        <h2>When "Trending" Starts to Mean "All the Same"</h2>
          <p>
            You might expect algorithms to expand food discovery by giving millions of restaurants and cuisines a chance to be seen. But in reality, research shows that platforms often push users toward the same popular foods again and again.
          </p>
          <p>
          A study of Indian food delivery platforms found that while apps increase access to the public, they also "homogenize preferences toward popular, algorithm-promoted options" (Hungund, 2025). This means:
        </p>
        
        <div class="homogenization-effects">
          <div class="effect-item">
            <span class="effect-icon">🔁</span>
            <p>The same viral dishes keep appearing</p>
          </div>
          <div class="effect-item">
            <span class="effect-icon">🍽️</span>
            <p>The same styles and flavors dominate</p>
          </div>
          <div class="effect-item">
            <span class="effect-icon">🏢</span>
            <p>The same chains rise to the top</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <p>
          Instead of encouraging exploration, algorithms reward repetition. Creators copy what already performs well. Users see the same foods repeatedly. Over time, food feeds across different cities and cultures begin to look surprisingly similar. What should be creative and diverse becomes predictable and uniform.

        <h2>Homogenization of Food Discovery</h2>
        <p>
          Virality may spread food, but it may also strip food of its cultural meaning. In this manner, Pagán (2022) illustrates how traditional Latinx foods such as esquites and aguas frescas often go viral under generic names on TikTok. The food becomes popular, but its cultural roots disappear from the story.
        </p>
        <div class="text-media text-media--two-column">
          <div class="text-media__text">
            <p>
              Campana (2021) came to the same conclusion: most of those viral recipes revolve around whiteness. The dishes of marginalized communities get reduced to the mainstream. The original creators are often people of color and get much less recognition while simultaneously white influencers get the algorithmic boost, sponsorships, and visibility.
            </p>
            <p>
              For this reason, platforms often:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Turn cultural food into quick "trends"</li>
              <li>Reward simplified, aesthetic versions of traditions</li>
              <li>Let the most dominant creators benefit from virality</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Food becomes digital content first, prior to cultural history.
            </p>

        <h2>Who the Algorithm Rewards</h2>
        <p>
          Algorithms do not treat all creators equally. As indicated in the very same study by Riswanto et al. (2025), people have longer fixations on posts with logos, influencer faces, and professional photography. Since the algorithm interprets this longer attention as "better" content, those posts would then become more likely to be promoted widely.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means:
        </p>
        
        <div class="algorithm-rewards">
          <div class="reward-patch">
            <p>Influencers and brands rise faster</p>
          </div>
          <div class="reward-divider"></div>
          <div class="reward-patch">
            <p>Small restaurants owned by locals or immigrants seldom have high visibility</p>
          </div>
          <div class="reward-divider"></div>
          <div class="reward-patch">
            <p>The home cooks with simple photos are easy to overlook</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <p>
          Visibility becomes tied not just to food quality, but to money, branding, and digital polish. Those with resources already will get more exposure, while culturally important and yet less "marketable" foods are buried.

        <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
        <p>
          When algorithms decide what food gets attention, they end up shaping how we understand food culture itself. What shows up in your feed slowly becomes what feels popular, exciting, and worth trying. This may make food culture feel narrower over time, push traditional foods out of the stage, and give more power to brands and influencers than to real communities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Food is more than something to scroll past. It carries stories, memories, and identity. But when visibility is driven by clicks instead of cultural meaning, those stories can get lost. Traditions risk being turned into trends or quietly disappearing from view.
